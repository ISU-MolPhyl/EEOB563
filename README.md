A graduate course on the theory and practice of phylogenetic analysis

**Instructor:** [Dennis Lavrov](https://sites.google.com/site/dennislavrov/)

**Time/Location:** Tuesday and Thursday, 9:00-10:50 AM in 203 Bessey Hall 

**Web View:** [https://isu-molphyl.github.io/EEOB563-Spring2018](https://isu-molphyl.github.io/EEOB563-Spring2018/)

## Reading Material

* [*Lecture Notes: The Mathematics of Phylogenetics*](https://jarhodesuaf.github.io/PhyloBook.pdf) by [E. S. Allman]() & [John A. Rhodes](https://jarhodesuaf.github.io/)

## Software Requirements

We will be using UNIX and Git throughout the course. If you are a Linux or MacOS user, you already have these tools installed.
If you are a Windows user, see the [installation guide](https://isu-molphyl.github.io/EEOB563-Spring2018/install) for instructions on installing.  
In addition, we will be using multiple phylogenetic programs in this class. All of them are free and most of them are already installed on the HPC-Class.
If you want to install them on your computer, use the links provided [here](https://isu-molphyl.github.io/EEOB563-Spring2018/links).
