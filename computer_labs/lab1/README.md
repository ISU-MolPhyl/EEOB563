# Lab 1 - Unix, Git and GitHub, SSH

This lab teaches about/reviews three important systems that we'll be using through the semester.

## Prerequisites:

### Install GitBash if you haven't done this already.
Follow the installation instructions provided in [install.md](https://github.com/ISU-MolPhyl/EEOB563-Spring2018/blob/master/install.md).

### Get a GitHub User Account

Create a user account on GitHub if you don't have one already. 
Be sure to choose a user ID that you are happy using for the rest 
of your professional career. GitHub is a very important tool for 
computational biology and if you continue working in data-intensive 
fields, you will be using this account again in the future. Join GitHub here:
