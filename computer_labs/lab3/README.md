## Lab 3 - Distance analysis with PAUP, PHYLIP, and FastME 

In this lab we will learn about three phylogenetic programs that can be used for distance analysis

## Prerequisites:

### Update your EEOB563-Spring2018 git repository
- Go to the repository and issue the following command: `git pull origin master`

### Make sure you have access to the programs
- You should already know how to use/install PAUP;  
- Phylip is installed as a module on HPC-Class (load with  `module load phylip`).  You can also install from its website ([see links]())
- FastME is installed as a module on HPC-Class. [Online version](http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/fastme/)
is also available, but you should avoid it to practice your command line skills.
