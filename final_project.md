# Final Project Guidelines for EEOB 563

The final project will consist of a paper and a presentation. You'll develop them in several steps.

## Step 1. Project outline on GitHub/GitLab
### March 26.
Project outline: be ready to present in class plus email me a GitHub/GitLab address. 
For the outline, simply give a sketch of your phylogenetic question and the proposed 
methods in less than 2 pages. Include a short introduction and the source(s) of data.

## Step 2. Submit complete ms. for a peer review
### April 18

Be ready to submit your paper for a peer review to two randomly assigned reviewers. 
Your paper should be a part of your GitHub/GitLab repository. Be ready to review 
two papers assigned to you.

The paper should be in the format of a typical research paper with Introduction, 
Methods, Results, and Discussion.  Length will vary depending on project topics, but 
you should aim for ~5 double-spaced pages (not including figures 
and references).  Since the focus of this class is on phylogenetic methods, your 
phylogenetic analysis will carry most of the weight for this project. However, to get a 
full grade, I expect you to ask (and at least attempt to answer) some additional questions based on 
the phylogenetic trees that you've inferred (e.g., correlated evolution, natural selection,
testing different topologies, molecular clock analysis, etc.).

### April 23
Return written reviews to authors. Provide the kind of positive, constructive review 
you would like to get on your own draft.

## Step 3. Submit the final version of your paper
### April 28 @11:59pm
Incorporate reviewers' comments into the final version of the ms.  
Enter the address of your repository on Canvas.

## Step 4. Presentations
### April 30, May 2 and May 7 (if we need more time)
The presentation should be a summary of your project in any format that you wish 
(though PowerPoint will probably make the most sense for displaying trees, etc.).  
Plan for a 15 minutes presentation and ~5 minutes for questions, etc. 
The presentation order will be determined randomly and posted on the website.
