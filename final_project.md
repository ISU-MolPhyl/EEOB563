# Final Project Guidelines for EEOB 563

The final project will consist of a paper and a presentation. You'll develop them in several steps.

## Step 1. Project outline on GitHub/LabHub
### March 20.
Final project outline: be ready to present in class plus email a GitHub/GitLab address. For the outline, simply give a sketch of your phylogenetic question and the proposed methods in less than 2 pages. Include a short introduction and the source(s) of data.

## Step 2. Complete project for peer review
### April 12

Be ready to submit your paper for a peer review by two randomly assigned reviewers. Your paper should be a part of your GitHub/GitLab repository. Be ready to review two papers assigned to you.

The paper should be in the format of a typical research paper with Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion.  Length will vary depending on project topics, but probably around 3 single-spaced pages will be sufficient (not including figures and references).  Since the focus of this class is phylogenetic methods, your Methods section will carry most of the weight for this project. The papers will be graded based on clarity of content and soundness of the methodology.  Fascinating, mind-bending results and implications are a plus! and probably an indicator of successful implementation of the methods, but are obviously not necessary for a good grade.  The main point is that you demonstrate some knowledge of the relative merits of different phylogenetics techniques and apply them in a relevant and hypothesis-driven way.


### April 17
Return written reviews to authors. Provide the kind of positive, constructive review you would like to get on your own draft.

## Step 3. Submit the final version of your paper
### April 22 @11:59pm
Incorporate reviewers' comments into the final version of the ms.  Send the address of your repository to the instructor.

## Step 4. Presentations
### April 24, 26 and May 4
The presentation should be a summary of your paper in any format that you wish (though PowerPoint will probably make the most sense for displaying trees, etc.).  Plan for a 15 minutes presentation and ~5 minutes for questions, etc. The presentation order will be determined randomly and posted on the website.
