# Final Project Guidelines for EEOB 563 (2021)

The final project will consist of a paper and a presentation.
You'll develop them in several steps.

## Step 1. Project outline on GitHub/GitLab
### March 30.
Project outline: be ready to present in class plus email me a GitHub/GitLab address.
For the outline, provide a draft of your phylogenetic question and the proposed
methods in less than 2 pages. Include a short introduction and the source(s) of data.

**Notice** There are only two weeks between the outline deadline and the complete ms.
deadline. This is a very short time. Start working on your ms. as soon as possible

## Step 2. Submit complete ms. for a peer review
### April 15
Be ready to submit a draft of your paper for a peer review!
You will be given emails of two randomly selected participants of the class.
Please send them an url linking to the GitHub (public) repository that contains
you ms. In turn, you will receive links to two repositories to review.
When you receive a link, first fork the repository, then clone the forked
repository on your computer and write a review inside it named [your lastname]\_review.Rmd.

The paper should be in the format of a typical research paper with Introduction,
Methods, Results, and Discussion.  The length will vary depending on project topics,
but you should aim for ~5 double-spaced pages (not including figures
and references).  Since the focus of this class is on phylogenetics,
**your phylogenetic analysis will carry most of the weight** for this project.
However, to get a full grade, I expect you to ask (and at least attempt to answer)
some additional questions based on the phylogenetic trees that you've inferred
(_e.g._, correlated evolution, natural selection,
testing different topologies, molecular clock analysis, _etc._).

### April 22
Return written reviews to the authors. Provide a kind of review you would like
to receive. If you haven't done it already, fork the
repository that contains the paper you reviewed and clone it on your computer.
Add your review to the repository, push it to GitHub and submit a Pull request
(use Google or ask on Slack, if you need more info!)
Accept the pull requests of your reviewers and start working on the final
version of your paper.

## Step 3. Submit the final version of your paper
### April 27 @11:59pm
Incorporate reviewers' comments into the final version of the ms.  
Enter the address of your repository on Canvas.

## Step 4. Presentations
### April 29, May 3 (Monday! 8-10am)
The presentation should be a summary of your project in any format that you wish
(though PowerPoint will probably make the most sense for displaying trees, etc.).  
Plan for a 15 minutes presentation and ~5 minutes for questions, etc.
The presentation order will be determined randomly and posted on the website.
