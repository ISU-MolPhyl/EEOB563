# EEOB 563 Installation Guide

## Unix & Git

We will be using UNIX and Git throughout the course. If you are a Linux or MacOS user, you already have these tools installed.
If you are a Windows user, see the Windows Users section below.  
In addition, we will be using multiple phylogenetic programs in this class. All of them are free and most of them are already installed on the [HPC-Class](https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides/classroom-hpc-cluster), to which you will have access.
If you want to install them on your computer, use the links provided [here](https://isu-molphyl.github.io/EEOB563/links).


### Windows Users

A Unix environment can be emulated using the “​Git Bash​” program [recommended], by partitioning your hard drive and installing Ubuntu (a free version of Linux),​ or by installing Cygwin​. These solutions for PC users may not be ideal for all course exercises and we can provide access to Mac computers if you would prefer to go this route.

* Git Bash: ​[https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash](https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash) 
* Ubuntu: [​https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi)
* Cygwin: ​[https://www.cygwin.com](https://www.cygwin.com)

## Text Editors 

It is recommended that you use an advanced text editor for this course and your research. Here are some options:

* vim or emacs (Unix, Mac OS X)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (Unix, Mac OS X, Windows)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Unix, Mac OS X, Windows)
* [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (Mac OS X)

## Slack

All course communication will be conducted via slack. You should have gotten an invitation to join the course slack team called **Molecular Phylogenetics** (if not, please let me know). Please be sure to check slack regularly for course updates. It is recommended that you download the Slack desktop app ([https://slack.com/downloads](https://slack.com/downloads)), which makes it easier to stay on top of messages.
