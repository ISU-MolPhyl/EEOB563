# EEOB 563 Installation Guide

## Unix & Git
### Mac or Linux
MacOSX and various Linux distributions are UNIX based, so just search for "Terminal" 
(On MacOSX the Terminal application is located in Applications -> Utilities). 

### Windows
If you are using a Windows computer, you will need to set up a working command-line environment.
There are several ways to do this. 

#### Git Bash
Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments, which provides 
an emulation layer for a Git command line experience.
Git Bash comes as part of the [Git For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org) 
package. In addition to Git, Git Bash provides an emulator for the Unix Bash shell.

#### Windows 10 and later
If you are using Windows 10 or later, you can follow the steps [outlined here]
(https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) 
to run a Unix-like command-line environment on your computer. 

## Phylogenetic software
We will be working on the ISU Classroom HPC Cluster, called 
[HPC-Class](https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides/classroom-hpc-cluster).
All phylogenetic software will be pre-installed on HPC-Class. If you want to install any program  
on your computer, use the links [provided](https://isu-molphyl.github.io/EEOB563/links).

## Text Editors 

It is recommended that you use an advanced text editor for this course and your research. Here are some options:

* vim or emacs (Unix, Mac OS X)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (Unix, Mac OS X, Windows)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Unix, Mac OS X, Windows)
* [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (Mac OS X)

## Slack

All course communication will be conducted via slack. You should have gotten an invitation to join the course slack team called **Molecular Phylogenetics** (if not, please let me know). Please be sure to check slack regularly for course updates. It is recommended that you download the Slack desktop app ([https://slack.com/downloads](https://slack.com/downloads)), which makes it easier to stay on top of messages.
